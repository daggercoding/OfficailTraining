Problem 3: Largest Product in a Grid
Objective: In a 20x20 grid, find the greatest product of four adjacent numbers (up, down, left, right, or 
diagonally).
for (let row = 0; row < 20; row++) {
 for (let col = 0; col < 20; col++) {
 // Calculate products in all directions and track maximum
 }
}
How to do it:
1.Parse the Grid: Represent the 20x20 grid in your code. This could be done using a 2D array or 
another suitable data structure.
2.Calculate Products: For each element in the grid, calculate the product of four adjacent numbers 
in all directions: horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
3.Track Maximum Product: Keep track of the maximum product obtained during the iteration.
